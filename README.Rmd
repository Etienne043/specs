# specs: Single-equation Penalized Error-Correction Selector

The R package `specs` implements the single-equation penalized error-correction selector proposed in Smeekes and Wijler (2018a) as an automated approach towards sparse single-equation cointegration modelling. In addition, the package contains the dataset used in the empirical application in Smeekes and Wijler (2018a) to predict Dutch unemployment rates based on Google Trends.

## Installation and Loading

### Installation

The development version of the `specs` package can be installed from
GitHub using

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wijler/specs")
```

### Load Package

After installation, the package can be loaded in the standard way:

``` r
library(specs)
```

## Data

Loading `specs` provides access to the dataset `Unempl_GT` which contains the monthly unemployment rates (x1000) in the Netherlands and a set of 87 related Google Trends aggregated to a monthly frequency. The data covers the period from 1 January 2014 to December 2017 and is used in the empirical application in Smeekes and Wijler (2018a).

## Sparse single-equation cointegration modelling

The package `specs` enables sparse and automated estimation of single-equation cointegration modelling. To estimate a conditional error-correction model (CECM) on the untransformed levels of a collection of time series, use the function `specs`. Conversion of the data matrix in levels to a CECM representation is performed automatically within the function. The user is free to set the number of lagged differences to include through the input `p`. In addition, the inclusion of deterministic (unpenalized) terms is governed via the input `deterministics = c("constant","trend","both","none")`. When it is not desired to explicitly model cointegration, the lagged levels can be omitted from the model by setting `ADL = TRUE`. This estimates a penalized autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model on the differenced data.

Alternatively, the user may choose to pre-transform the data into the form of a CECM/ADL, for example to save on computation time in rolling window forecast exercises, and use the function `specs_tr` instead. This function operates entirely analogous to `specs`, with the exception of requiring a differenced dependent variable (`y_d`), the lagged levels of the time series (`z_l`) and the required difference of the data (`w`) as inputs. Since `w` is directly provided to the function, the option to set the lag length `p` is omitted. When `ADL=TRUE`, the user may omit `z_l` as an input. 

Note that within this package the coefficients corresponding to `z_l` are referred to as `delta`, those corresponding to `w` as `pi`, and the numeric object that stacks both `delta` and `pi` is referred to as `gamma`. The deterministic terms are passed to the function outputs as `d`, with there coefficients being referred to as `theta`. When `ADL=TRUE`, `delta` is omitted from the numeric object `gamma` in the output. The naming of objects here is congruent with Smeekes and Wijler (2018a), which may serve as a helpful guideline for implementation.

**Penalty**

The functions `specs`, or equivalently `specs_tr`, estimate the model by variants of penalized regression, customized to the error-correction framework. In its most general form, specs penalizes each individual coefficient via `lambda_i`, and adds a group penalty on `delta` via `lambda_g`. Unless sequences of positive numbers for `lambda_i` and/or `lambda_g` are supplied, sequences are generated automatically. The largest value in each respective penalty sequence is chosen as the smallest value that sets all the coefficients that it penalizes equal to zero. The smallest penalty in the sequence is chosen as 1e-4 times the largest value in the penalty sequence. As an important special case, the user may set `lambda_g = 0`, in which case the function will estimate the model by (weighted) $L_1$-penalized regression, i.e. the (adaptive) lasso. `specs` estimates a unique solution for each combination of penalty parameters and, among others, provides a matrix containing the corresponding coefficients called `gamma` as output.

In practice, one typically requires a single choice of penalties that provides the optimal solution for the model building exercise at hand. To facilitate selection of such an optimal penalty, the functions `specs_opt` and `specs_tr_opt`, being the equivalents of `specs` and `specs_tr`, respectively, come with the added functionality of automated selection of optimal values for `lambda_i` and `lambda_g`. The selection criteria can be set via the input `rule`, with the possible choices being `BIC`, `AIC` or time series cross-validation (`TSCV`). The first two are information criteria in which the degrees of freedom is approximated by the number of non-zero coefficients for a particular solution, whereas the latter is a form of cross-validation that respects the time series structure of the data. The implementation details for TSCV can be found in Smeekes and Wijler (2018b, p. 411). Both the optimal penalty values, as well as the corresponding estimated coefficients are included in the output.

**Weights**

Finally, specs can be estimated with the use of adaptively weighted penalization. Automatically generated weighting schemes are available via the input `weights = c("ridge","ols","none")`. The default option, `"ridge"` constructs the weights via the use of initial estimates obtained by ridge regression. In detail, the weights for $\delta_i$ and $\pi_j$ are constructed as $|\hat{\delta}_i|^{-k_\delta}$ and $|\hat{\pi}_j|^{-k_\pi}$, respectively. The penalty parameter for the ridge regression is automatically chosen by TSCV. Alternative options are to automatically generate weights via initial ols estimates (`weights = "ols"`) or to refrain from adaptive weighting altogether (`weights = "none"`). Alternatively, it is also possible to supply a sequence of positive weights directly. Finally, the values for $k_\delta$ and $k_\pi$ can be chosen by the user via the equivalently named input options `k_delta` and `k_pi`. The optimal values for these parameters are case-dependent, although some theoretical guidance is provided in table 1 of Smeekes and Wijler (2018a).

**Algorithm and Implementation**

The package `specs` combines accelerated generalized gradient descent for the estimation of $\delta$ with coordinatewise descent for the estimation of $\pi$. Since $\delta$ is penalized by both an $L_1$- and $L_2$-penalty, its estimation fits into the framework of the so-called sparse group lasso, for which numerous computational procedures have been proposed. This package adopts the algorithm of Simon et al. (2013), as the use of accelerated gradient descent via Nesterov updates greatly improves computational time. However, since $\pi$ is regularized via an $L_1$-penalty, and is separable from the penalty on $\delta$, the optimal solution for $\pi$ is calculated via the coordinate-wise descent procedure proposed in Friedman et al. (2009). Essentially, `specs` iterates between optimizing for $\delta$ and $\pi$, where within each iteration one of the aforementioned two algorithms is repeated until numerical convergence. All calculation are performed in C++, with the help of the Rcpp and Armadillo packages.
