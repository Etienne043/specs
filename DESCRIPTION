Description: This pakackage estimates SPECS, your favourite Single-equation Penalized Error-Correction Selector. SPECS
    provides a fully automated estimation procedure for large and potentially (co)integraded datasets. The dataset in levels
    is converted to a conditional error-correction model, either by the user or by means of the functions included in this package,
    and various specialised forms of penalized regression can be applied to the model. Automated options for initializing 
    and selecting a sequence of penalties, as well as the construction of penalty weights via an initial estimator, are available. 
    Moreover, the user may choose from a number of pre-specified deterministic configurations to further simplify the model 
    building process.
